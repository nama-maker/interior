<p><b>Interior design is the art & science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier & 
    more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. With a keen eye for detail & 
    a creative flair,an interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, & manages such 
    enhancement projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes space planning, 
    programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project,construction management & 
    execution of the design.
    The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the 
    complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes.
    The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed 
    to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior
    design is separate and distinct from the role of interior decorator, a term commonly used in 
    the US; the term is less common in the UK, where the profession of interior design is still 
    unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.</b></p>

<p><b>Let us firstly understand that modular kitchens are just about two decades old in India. So the concept 
    of ‘traditional’ in India will vary from the Western style. In our context, a traditional interior in 
    kitchen would look something like this; in fact, it is a legacy model of the very first modular kitchens 
    and perhaps the framework for modular kitchen ideas India. Cabinets will have grooves and handles, there
    will be lofts, wall cabinets and base cabinets. Appliances are not part of the cabinets and there is just 
    one source of lighting The backsplash will be neutral and you will see typical Indian elements in the 
    tiling.</b></p>

<p><b>Every house can benefit from blending with nature, and in the current urban environment, 
    there’s no better way to achieve this than with internal gardens for modern Indian homes. 
    Besides adding a stunning feature to the interiors of the house, an interior courtyard 
    garden provides a relaxing retreat where one can refresh one’s energy amid the soothing 
    greenery. In modern Indian homes, it’s easy to incorporate an internal garden seamlessly 
    with the help of glass walls, sliding doors and retractable ceilings.</b></p>
